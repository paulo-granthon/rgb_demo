// Introduction //

	this document is meant to be a guide for some small things of the game, nothing here needs to make total sense
	no need of corrections of the text here and no need of everything here to become part of the actual game.

// Colors //

	description of the 3 colors currently on the game's idea, with the profile of each and why these colors are different.
	the profiles describes the "main goal" of the color, the color is more likely to act this way but not always, there are
	exceptions

	// R, Red, Logic

		this color is more likely to use complex strategies and unusual / non-combat related ways to 
		become stronger than the opponent during a battle, this includes constant use of fusion, 
		artifacts, magic cards and other things. They're aggro / mid-aggro, always using strategies 
		but never "locking" the game, as they don't use so much "locking game" cards, they prefer to 
		build their own power instead

		the core of this color is Logic / Strategy / Thinking.

	// B, Blue, Haste

		this color try to speed the game constantly, using as many actions as possible with low-cost cards
		to build their power and damage the opponent, making them most likely to act full aggro during the game
		they use even less "locking game" cards than the Red color as they are always trying to speed things up

		the core of this color is Haste / Speed / Aggressiveness.

	// G, Green, Pacience

		this color is constantly trying to build their own power, keeping resources some times to use powerfull
		cards at once. They're slow, but they're strong, and they will try to gather as many resources as possible
		during the early game to become stronger at mid / late game to win by combat or even winning by lock game
		making them almost always control but sometimes capable of being mid-aggro as well. They have and they will
		use locking game cards and a lot of artifacts

		the core of this color is the Pacience / Power  / Building.

// RULES //

// about the battle:

	// each player starts with their own deck of cards, the deck is edited only before entering a battle for obvious reasons
	
	// in the beggining of the game, is called the round 0 when both players draws their hand with a fixed number of cards
	(global number)

	// somehow the players decides who will play first (like a dice or a coin roll) and then the game starts, until here pretty normal

	// each turn players can use cards to call actions such as summon a minion, use a magic card or artifact, etc

	// the game ends imediatly when a player reaches 0 HP or when someone try to draw but have no cards in the deck to draw

// about the mechanics:

	// decks are made of a certain number of cards (need to set a number, i don't know how many cards make a good deck that is playable
	and balanced) with some repeated cards and a lot of energy cards (i don't know exactly how many but i think it needs to be 
	between 50% and 35% of the deck to be playable)

	// every card except energy cards have a use cost with some number(s) (it can be 0) and it's respectives colors 
	example: to summon the imaginary card "basic red minion" you need 3 'RED' energys

	// to spend energy cards, you have to discard them to the graveyard (think i should change this name to something more 
	light-and-dark-like, but for now let's refer to it as a graveyard) from your hand or a 'deposit' card (deposit cards are 
	artifact or magic cards that you can put a number of energy cards to use it from the table, pretty usefull)

	// when someone's turn begins, this player draws cards until it reaches his/her hand size (by default is a global number that i
	need to set, but i think like 6 is a good number for this), this way this player will draw more than one card if he/she spend energy
	from hand last turn or used a lot of cards, making the game a little more dynamic since there's a lot of discart whenever you use a card, 
	or if he/she already have the hand size in his/her hand, he/she draws only one card (and the hand size can be upgraded in mid-game by 
	cards' effects)

// some extras:

	// there are 'huge' cards that will be used like common tools for a lot of decks like a fusion card (white/incolor to make it easy for
	all 3 collors to use, but will depend on materials. Red will have the biggest number of fusion cards amongst the collors for example), 
	the deposit card, that gives a lot of mechanic into the game, and some other. Your "powers" in the game will depend on your cards, magics,
	artifacts, effects of monsters, all will make difference in the actions you can do and mechanic-like features you have

	// there will be fusions with different collors and some features that help not only one collor, it's possible to make a deck with more
	than one collor in adition to white/incolor cards (not sure if hybrid cards with more than one collor/specie will be a thing since it's 
	a little more complex for thinking about)
