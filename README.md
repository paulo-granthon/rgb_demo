# ðŸ“œ Rules:

</summary>

- Each player has it's custom deck and battles until their life points are reduced to 0 or they have no cards left on the deck.  

- Each non-energy card has it's own use cost. You discard Energy cards to get energy of that color to play cards.
Energy stays stored in your "pool" between turns.  

- When someone's turn starts, the player draws cards until they have 7 in the hand.  
Every subsequent turn, the player of that turn can draw one card.  

- Creatures on your side of field can attack creatures on the opponent's side of the field.
When a player has no creatures on their side of the field, you can attack their life points directly.
